[script]
# Suffix to append to client hostnames when creating DNS records.
# e.g., if client name is "my-laptop" and suffix is ".lan", DNS record will be "my-laptop.lan"
# If a client has a name like "foo.bar.baz" and this is ".lan", it will become "foo.bar.baz.lan"
# If you want to use the network name as part of the domain, you'll need to customize the script.
# For example, client "my-pc" on network "Office" could become "my-pc.office.lan".
# Default is ".local"

# This is used if not running via cron entrypoint (e.g. direct script execution)
# For Docker, cron schedule is set via CRON_SCHEDULE env var.
