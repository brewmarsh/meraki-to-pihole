# This is an example environment file.
# Copy this to .env and fill in your actual values.
# This .env file is typically used by docker-compose.

# Required: Your Meraki API Key
MERAKI_API_KEY=

# Required: URL for your Pi-hole instance's API
# Example: PIHOLE_API_URL=http://192.168.1.10/admin/api.php
# This value should be set in your config.ini. The Python script currently reads it from there.
# If you modify the script to read from ENV, this variable would be directly used.
PIHOLE_API_URL=

# Required: Your Pi-hole API Key (if password protected)
# Found in Pi-hole settings -> API / Web interface -> Show API Token.
# This value should be set in your config.ini. The Python script currently reads it from there.
# If you modify the script to read from ENV, this variable would be directly used.
PIHOLE_API_KEY=

# Optional: Cron schedule for the sync. Overrides Dockerfile default.
# Example: CRON_SCHEDULE="0 4 * * *"  (runs daily at 4:00 AM)
CRON_SCHEDULE="0 3 * * *"

# Optional: Timezone for the container, affects cron job timing.
# Example: TZ=America/New_York
TZ=UTC

# Note: The Python script (app/meraki_pihole_sync.py) reads MERAKI_API_KEY from the environment.
# Pi-hole API URL and Key, Meraki Organization ID, and Network IDs are read from the config.ini file
# located at /config/config.ini inside the container.
# The docker-compose.yml mounts a local directory (e.g., ./config_prod) to /config in the container.
# You must create a config.ini file in that local directory with your specific settings.
#
# The PIHOLE_API_URL and PIHOLE_API_KEY variables are listed here for completeness if you decide
# to modify the script to prioritize environment variables for these settings over the config.ini file.
# As of the current script version, they are primarily set in config.ini.
